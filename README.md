## Release Channels & Upgrade Path
- **Stable** — Fully vetted releases recommended for production servers; expect only critical hotfixes between major updates.
- **Release Candidate (RC)** — Final verification builds that preview the upcoming stable release; suitable for staging environments that mirror production.
- **Beta** — Feature-complete builds undergoing active testing; best for enthusiasts who want early access and can tolerate occasional regressions.
- **Nightly** — Automated snapshots of the latest development work; ideal for contributors validating fixes, but not advised for live servers.

See [docs/versioning.md](docs/versioning.md) for comprehensive versioning policies, upgrade guidance, and support timelines.
