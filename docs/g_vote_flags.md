# `g_vote_flags` Reference

The `g_vote_flags` cvar controls which vote types players can initiate. By
default the server enables every vote (`g_vote_flags 16383`) so the Call Vote menu
lists all available actions. You can override this by setting the cvar to the
bitwise OR of the options you want to allow.
