# WORR!
### An extensive server mod for QUAKE II Rerelease

**WORR** is an advanced gameplay expansion and server mod for **QUAKE II Rerelease**, designed to bring a richer, more dynamic single-player and multiplayer experience.
It dramatically extends entity and gameplay support, integrates modern competitive systems, and refines the core feel of QUAKE II while preserving its fast-paced essence.

It's a successor to my previous project, [Muff Mode](https://github.com/themuffinator/muffmode).
