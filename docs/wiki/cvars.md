# WORR Cvar Reference

This reference consolidates the gameplay-facing console variables (cvars) that WORR registers on startup. Each table lists the default value supplied by the server module, the scope implied by its cvar flags, and practical usage notes derived from the systems that read the setting. Flag meanings follow the engine definitions (`CVAR_SERVERINFO` replicates to clients, `CVAR_LATCH` defers changes until the next map load, etc.).

## Reading the tables

| Scope tag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| **Live** | `CVAR_NOFLAGS` – may be changed during a match. |
| **Serverinfo** | `CVAR_SERVERINFO` – published to clients via `serverinfo`. |
| **Userinfo** | `CVAR_USERINFO` – part of client authentication flow. |
| **Archive** | `CVAR_ARCHIVE` – persisted to config files. |
| **Latch** | `CVAR_LATCH` – applies after a map or server restart. |
| **NoSet** | `CVAR_NOSET` – locked at runtime; change from command line or config only. |
